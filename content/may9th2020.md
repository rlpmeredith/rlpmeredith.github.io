# Some notes on setting up Pelican on github

So I decided to set up a blog. Not for the first time! We shall see if this survives!

Pelican is an Python package that generates static webpages. Docs are [here](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html)

So I used instructions from this link to set this up:

[Blog page from Erik O'Shaughnessy](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)

Some lessons learned:

No spaces between [] and () when making links! 
Dates need to be US format? (I will look at this) 
Need to specify URL in both pelicanconf and publish conf  
Two spaces at the end of a line in markdown for a new line!  
I set up ssh access to github and then wrote a mini bash script to automate. Then I can just edit files in content and publish.

Script looks like this:

```shellscript
#!/usr/bin/env bash
if [ "$PWD" != "$HOME/projects/my_static_blog" ]
then
  echo "Wrong Directory"
  exit
fi

if [ "$VIRTUAL_ENV" != $HOME/venvs/my_static_blog ]
then
  echo "Wrong environment"
  exit
fi

if [ $# != 1 ]
then
  echo "No arguments supplied - Useage is publish_robblog -'Commit Comment'"
  exit
fi

pelican content -o output -s publishconf.py
ghp-import -m "Generate Pelican site" --no-jekyll -b master output
git push origin master
git add content
git commit -m $1
git push origin content
```
