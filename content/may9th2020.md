# Some notes on setting up Pelican on github

So I decided to set up a blog. Not for the first time! We shall see if this survives!

Pelican is an Python package that generates static webpages. Docs are [here](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html)

So a few links I used to set this up:

[Blog page from Erik O'Shaughnessy](https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)

Some lessons learned:

No spaces between [] and () when making links!
Dates need to be US format? (I will look at this)
Need to specify URL in both pelicanconf and publish conf
I set up ssh access to github and then wrote a mini bash cript to automate. Then I can just edit files in content and publish.
