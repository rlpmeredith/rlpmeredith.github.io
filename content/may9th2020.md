# Some notes on setting up Pelican on github

So I decided to set up a blog. Not for the first time! We shall see if this survives!

Pelican is an Python package that generates static webpages. Docs are [here] (https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/index.html)

So a few links I used to set this up:

[Blog page from Erik O'Shaughnessy] (https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python)

And a page on workflow from [Anotherdatum] (https://anotherdatum.com/pelican-and-github-pages-workflow.html)

I am using this page to see if that workflow works! Also writing this in Vi. There has to be a better way to write Markdown.....

And how do these dates work....................!? Answer is you have ot manually enter today's date?

OK seventh attempt!
