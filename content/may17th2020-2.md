As I can never remember the syntax here is an aide de memoire for Python's unittest module.

So we need to import the module:

​	:::python

​	import unittest

Then we need a test class that imports from the TestCase class:

```
:::python
class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
```

We need to call the test by changing the command line entry point:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
	unittest.main()
```

And then we need to create some methods for the class to create the tests making sure that the method name starts with "test":

```
	def test_sum(self):
		self.assert(my_function([1,2,3]), answer, "Should be answer")
```

Putting it all together to test an example function looks like this:

```
import unittest

def add_it_up(my_list):
    return sum(my_list)

class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_sum(self):
        self.assertEqual(add_it_up([1, 2, 3]), 6, "Should be 6")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
There's a great tutorial at [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-testing/) which has information on how to split out the tests from the code and structure the tests in a real project.
